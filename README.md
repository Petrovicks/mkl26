# mkl26

Support crate for the MKL26 family of microcontrollers from NXP.

This crate was made originally to support the [Teensy LC](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyLC.html)
and is currently tested solely on that platform. That said, only the examples are written assuming 
the use of a Teensy LC. If any code outside of the examples is found to not work on another
platform, please create an issue.
